1. number  --> the number is added to the number
2. string --> 
one of the operands is a string and a number is added to it
3. string --> arithmetic operation + the expression is implicitly converted to a string
4. string --> arithmetic operation +  the expression is implicitly converted to a string
5. number --> arithmetic operation -  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
6. number --> unary plus +  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
7. number --> unary plus +  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
8. number --> unary plus +  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
9.  number --> unary plus +  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
10. string --> one of the operands is a string and a number is added to it
11. string --> arithmetic operation + the expression is implicitly converted to a string
12. string --> the result will be an empty string
13. number -->  arithmetic operation -  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
14. number --> arithmetic operation -  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
15. number --> arithmetic operation -  the expression is implicitly converted to a number
