1. 2 (both arg are numbers - just a Math) 
2. '11' (one of arg is string all expression convert to string values ​​were just added )
3. '12' (all expression convert to string values ​​were just added )
4. '1[object...' (all expression convert to string values ​​were just added)
5. NaN (object is Not a Number - NaN. If one of arg if NaN all expression is will be NaN)
6. NaN (attempt to perform a math. operation not with a number)
7. 0 ('' === 0)
8. -1 (despite the fact that the data type is a string, it contains a math. expression)
9. NaN (object is Not a Number - NaN. If one of arg if NaN all expression is will be NaN)
10. '1a' (all expression convert to string values ​​were just added )
11. '1[object...' (all expression convert to string values ​​were just added)
12. ' ' result is an empty string (all expression convert to string values ​​were just added)
13. NaN (attempt to perform a math. operation not with a number)
